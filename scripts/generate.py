Do NOT report today's breaking news — the sister channel covers that. Instead pick
ONE evergreen subject and tell it properly: a legend's career arc, a historic game
or series, a franchise turning point, a tactical breakdown, a statistical deep dive,
a 'what if this trade never happened' scenario, or a season retrospective.
Tone: calm, authoritative, documentary. Build a narrative with a beginning, a
turn and a payoff. Use concrete numbers and dates. No hype, no clickbait shouting.
Titles must be analytical and intriguing, never ALL-CAPS screaming.
For the thumbnail: thumb_word should be a calm editorial phrase (e.g. "THE FULL
STORY", "WHAT REALLY HAPPENED", "THE TURNING POINT") or empty, never hype
screaming. thumb_prompt should describe a moody, archival, documentary scene."""

news: trades, rumors, injuries, quotes, games (if in season, yesterday's game is the
lead story), Summer League, roster analysis. Check multiple sources (ESPN, SNY,
New York Post, HoopsHype, RealGM). If news is thin, add one deep-dive topic
(roster analysis, historical Knicks story, player profile, season projection).
Blend in commentary and opinion, and where natural connect today's stories to
history: past transfers, training camps, game preparations, players' career
arcs and iconic Knicks moments. Make it feel like an expert host talking.

EPISODE ANGLE: {SLOT_ANGLES[slot]}

AVOID repeating these recent topics:
{recent_topics or "(none)"}

CONTENT MIX: today's news is the spine of the episode, but you are a commentator,
not a news reader — give YOUR analysis and opinions on every story. Weave in
historical context where it fits: past trades and how they aged, training camp
and game-prep storylines, players' career histories and personal journeys,
franchise history parallels. Connect today to the bigger picture.

Then write an energetic, conversational ~{WORDS}-word English narration script
(target {MINUTES} minutes at ~150 wpm). Short sentences. No abbreviations that read
badly aloud (say "points per game", not "PPG"). 6-9 sections, 45-60 paragraphs total,
60-110 words each. EVERY paragraph must have card_title and card_lines filled.
Total word count across all paragraph texts MUST be between {WORDS-500} and {WORDS+300}.
